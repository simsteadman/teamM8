### ABOUT ###
 
TEAM M8 is a simple, web-based application which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.

The functionality means this app can be transferred in its use beyond table tennis to any event, sport or scenario where a randomised 'vs' pairing is required. 

The app runs in all modern web browsers and has been written using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
 

### INSTALLATION AND SETUP ###

1. Unzip the contents of the "app" folder to a local location of your choice.

2. The 'app' folder must retain all files within its original folder structure in order for it to work. The application will not work correctly if any files are deleted, altered or moved.  

3. To open the app, double-click the "index.html" file. The application will open within a tab on your default web browser. 

NOTE: the application will run offline, but an internet connection is recommended in order to enjoy the full experience. 



### HOW IT WORKS - INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Insert player names separately into the "Type to add player name" field. 

2. Hit "ENTER" or click the 'Add Player' button to add the player name to the list. 
You can add as many names as you like as long as all the names equate to an even number. 

3. Hit "Randomise and Match" to randomise and match the players inputted on the previous step. You can keep pressing the button to keep shuffling the players. The application engine will pair your names together with a 'vs' in-between both names. 

4. The RESET button will reload the page. Note that on reset, your fixtures will be lost, so use with caution!
